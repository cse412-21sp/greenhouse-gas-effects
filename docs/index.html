    This map illustrates the average greenhouse gas emissions produced by each country with available data, with more environmentally unfriendly countries labelled in increasingly vibrant red.
    The global “superpowers” - United States, China, Russia, India - all immediately jump off the screen as being the biggest producers of greenhouse gasses. However, which other countries rise to the top of the list?

The environmental policy index is an index from 0 (least stringent) to 6 (most stringent) based on 14 environmental policy ratings focusing on climate and air pollution.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/shared/QC7CH9M8X?:display_count=y&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="400"></iframe><p>This visualization shows many of the countries with the highest environmental policy index are in Europe, with Canada in the range with Europe as well.
Additionally, it is interesting that much of the data is missing for Central and South America, Africa, and Central Asia.</p><p>Next we will look at what countries use taxes related to environmental effects using environmental taxes as a percent of GDP.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/environmental_tax/Sheet1?:language=en&amp;:display_count=y&amp;publish=yes&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="400"></iframe><p>Here we find that most countries have very small environmental tax rates, with most countries outside of Europe in the 1-2% rate, and much of Europe in the 2-3% rate.
Interesting outliers include Mauritania with an environmental tax rate above 5% of GDP, and Mexico with an environmental tax rate of -.2% of GDP.</p><h1 id="consequences---health">Consequences - Health</h1><p>For this section we will look at how environmental risks can affect health.
Disability Affected Years (DALYs) is a way of measuring the burden of disease. It
combines years of life lost and years of healthy life lost due to sickness or disability.
Below is a map of the average DALYs per 1000 residents averaging from 1990-2019.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/shared/DKBRJYDKR?:display_count=y&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="400"></iframe><p>Below is a map that shows the DALYs per 1000 residents from 1990-2019. Note that some years do not have data and appear gray.</p><img src="./static/images/daly_map.png" alt="example"/><p>We can see that while the countries with the worst health tend to be in central Africa, we can also see that the number is decreasing as the years progress.</p><h2 id="i-have-an-animated-map-but-i-was-having-trouble,-will-come-back-to-later">I have an animated map but I was having trouble, will come back to later</h2><p>Then we want to see the trend for DALYs over time. Below shows the DALYs per 1000 resients for the
top 10 countries in GHG emissions from 1990-2019.</p><iframe src="https://public.tableau.com/views/EnvRisks2/Sheet2?:language=en&amp;:display_count=y&amp;:origin=viz_share_link:showVizHome=no&amp;:embed=true" width="100%" height="450"></iframe><p>We can see that there has been a steady decline in DALYs over the past 30 years across
all 10 countries.</p><h1 id="moving-forward">Moving Forward</h1><p>This is a rough outline of how we will be presenting our data. We have started with some ideas
for visualizations. We hope to use those to make more animated designs, particularly for the maps.
We are still in progress of working through those in vega-lite and then we will add those into our
design.</p><h1 id="analysis-and-conclusion">Analysis and Conclusion</h1><p>We can start to see some connections through these different areas. Places with higher environmental tax rates tend to have lower GHG emissions,
like Canada and Europe. While the data on DALYs showed data on where the world is sicker and healthier over the years, there was
not a strong visible connection. It would be interesting to see data on specifically health related to pollution and be able to compare that to
the levels of GHG.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed!</p></div></div></div></div>
